# 🔐 Environment Security Guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE

Your API keys are now configured securely in `.env.local` which is automatically ignored by git and will never be committed to your repository.

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### ✅ What's Secure:
- `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` - will never be committed
- API keys are only loaded server-side
- Environment variables are not exposed to client-side code
- Each environment (dev/staging/prod) has separate configurations

### 🔑 Your Current API Key Configuration:
- **Gemini AI**: ✅ Configured and secure
- **Perplexity AI**: ✅ Configured and secure
- **OpenAI**: ⚪ Add when available
- **Anthropic Claude**: ⚪ Add when available

## 🚀 Testing Your AI Integration

You can now test your AI features:

1. **Gemini AI** - Ready for content generation
2. **Perplexity AI** - Ready for research-enhanced content

## 📋 Production Deployment Security

When deploying to production (Vercel, Netlify, etc.):

### Vercel:
```bash
vercel env add GEMINI_API_KEY
vercel env add PERPLEXITY_API_KEY
```

### Environment Variables Dashboard:
- Go to your project settings
- Add environment variables one by one
- Never paste them in public places

## 🔄 How to Rotate Keys (Recommended Monthly):
1. Generate new API keys from provider dashboards
2. Update `.env.local` locally
3. Update production environment variables
4. Test all integrations
5. Revoke old keys

## 🚨 If Keys Are Ever Compromised:
1. **Immediately** revoke keys from provider dashboards
2. Generate new keys
3. Update all environments
4. Monitor usage for unauthorized access

## 💡 Additional Security Tips:
- Use different keys for development/production
- Set up usage limits on your API keys
- Monitor API usage regularly
- Enable billing alerts
- Use environment-specific restrictions when available

**Remember: Never share API keys in chat, email, or commit them to git!**
